# About me
Born in Miami Florida and raised in Fort Lauderdale. After High-School at American Heritage I went to Florida State University to study computer science.

After four years of study I left FSU and joined the Marine Corps. In the Marines I worked in the intelligence field supporting RF electronic equipment and software for the 1st Radio Battalion. We supported the SIGINT community providing resources for our greater intelligence community. Forever grateful for the everlasting relationships developed during this time in my life. 

After the Marines I became a defense contractor and started working as Systems Administrator for an AirForce GEOINT squadron in the AF-DCGS.
I did this for 10 years, where I worked with some of the smartest people in my career. We got to travel the world with this job, 
and I am forever thankful for that experience

After years of working in the DCGS, I moved down to Tampa Florida to work for CENTCOM and SOCOM. I currently work with the
Command Digital and Artifical Intelligence Office (CDAO) on all things related to AI/ML.

# Code
I love to code in Python, Golang, Rust, Angular (typescript), React, Java and C.

Automation is my Jam! Worked for a year at SOCOM J6 as an automation Engineer for Red Hat. I primarily used ansible engine/tower
to help automate installations, configurations, updates, patches, etc.

Containers and Orchestration for the win! I live on the Fedora SilverBlue OS. Utilize podman and kubectl for anything I can.

# Tech
Way too many to list... I'll let Hugo do it for me :wink:
