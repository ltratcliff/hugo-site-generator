# About me
Born in Miami Florida and raised in Fort Lauderdale. After High-School I went to FSU to study computer science.

After four years of study I left FSU and joined the Marines. In the Marines I worked on electronic equiptment for a SIGINT Battalion.

After the Marines I became a defense contractor and started working as Systems Administrator for an AirForce GEOINT squadron in the AF-DCGS.
I did this for 10 years where I worked with some of the smartest people in my career. We got to travel the world with this job, 
and I am forever thankful for that experience

After years of working in the DCGS, I moved down to Tampa Florida to work for CENTCOM and SOCOM. I currently work with the
Command Data Office (CDO) on all things related to AI/ML.

# Code
I love to code in Python, Golang, Angular (typescript), Java and C.

Automation is my Jam! Worked for a year in SOCOM as an automation Engineer for Red Hat. I primarily used ansible engine/tower
to help automate installations, configurations, updates, patches, etc. etc.

Containers and Orchestration for the win! I live on the Fedora SilverBlue OS. Utilize podman and kubectl for anything I can.

# Tech
Way too many to list... I'll let Hugo do it for me :wink:
